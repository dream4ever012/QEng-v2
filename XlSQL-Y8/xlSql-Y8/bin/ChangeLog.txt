Changes between version Y7 and Y8 (by Csongor Nyulas):

- multiple connection issues are solved (driver tries to connect 
  only to valid URLs; initializing driver with configuration files 
  does not throw exception anymore; no multiple registreation of 
  the xlDriver and its back-end drivers; the usage of the 
  xlEngineDriver - a wrapping driver for the back-end drivers 
  with no particular functionality - is eliminated etc.)

- HSQLDB back-end is properly shutdown at time of closing the connection

- MySQL back-end implementation is changed so that it not uses 
  different schemas for each Excel file, but all the Excel sheets 
  are tables in the same schema (provided by the JDBC URL). This also 
  eliminates problems due to access rights restrictions and final cleanup.

- problems with time recognision are eliminated (as far as JExcelApi is able 
  to deal with them xlSql driver will be able to deal with them too)

- upgraded to use JExcel API 2.6.6 (especially bacause of some bugs 
  in the recognision of TIME column types with the use of isTime() function)

- updated additional jar files
    - jxl.jar (new version is 2.6.6)
    - MySQL JDBC driver (version 5.1.6 instead of 3.0.10)
    - jconfig.jar (new version is 2.8.5)

- updates in the "bin" directory: TestXlsql.java, xlsqlenv.bat, build.xml

Note: the crimson.jar, jaxp.jar and jmxri.jar files in the "lib/jconfig"
      directory seem to be not used. Adding them to the CLASSPATH is not 
      necessary
