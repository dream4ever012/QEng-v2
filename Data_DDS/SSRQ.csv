ssrqid2992,Usability ,"Define the quality of system use (e.g. measurable effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction criteria)."
ssrqid2993,Operational ,"Define the operational conditions or properties that are required for the system to operate or exist. This type of requirement includes: human factors, ergonomics, availability, maintainability, reliability, and security."
ssrqid2994,Adaptability ,"Define potential extension, growth, or scalability during the life of the system."
ssrqid2995,Functional ,Describe qualitatively the system functions or tasks to be performed in operation.
ssrqid2996,Functional ,Describe qualitatively the system functions or tasks to be performed in operation.
ssrqid2997,Performance ,"Define quantitatively the extent, or how well, and under what conditions a function or task is to be performed (e.g. rates, velocities). These are quantitative requirements of system performance and are verifiable individually. Note that there may be more than one performance requirement associated with a single function, functional requirement, or task."
