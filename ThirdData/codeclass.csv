"PCA12","""If the drug volume in the reservoir measures less than Vlra = 1 ml, and an infusion is in progress, a low-reservoir warning100 shall be issued.""","Peikang","4/12/2016","V3.4"
"PCA13","""The drug library102 can be thought of as a lookup table that, given a drug name and a location, provides typical and safe limits of different infusion parameters. The drug library shall be determined by an authorized and authenticated hospital pharmacist""","Hotmail","4/13/2016","V1.5"
"PCA14","""If a drug library’s soft limit is violated by the proposed settings, but not a hard limit, a warning is shown to the clinician by the user interface and a distinctive, irritating sound made and recorded in the Event Log.""","Hotmail","4/14/2016","V2.5"
"PCA15","""The PCA pump shall implement a safety architecture112 that separates normal operation from fault detection and response.""","Hotmail","4/15/2016","V3.5"
"PCA16","""When the stop button is pressed, the current pump stroke shall be completed prior to stopping the pump.""","Hotmail","4/16/2016","V1.6"

"PCA22","""Hardware faults detected, but not masked, shall raise a fault alarm, stop pump, record it in the Fault Log, and display the reason for fault on the user interface.""","Alex","4/22/2016","V1.8"
"PCA23","""Hardware faults that prevent operation of the Control Panel shall illuminate a hardware fault indicator  (light-emitting diode).""","Alex","4/23/2016","V2.8"
"PCA24","""Because the drugs used for analgesia are often narcotic, requiring Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) tracking if used in the United States, the drug reservoir and means to change prescriptions""","Alex","4/24/2016","V3.8"
